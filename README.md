# Repository for My Résumé Webpage

Learning Web Development is first step for many developers out there, so I too went ahead to learn and explore it. And what better way than to make a project to learn and test your skills.

- I used basic HTML and CSS to make this page
- It is a digital resume of mine

I hope to learn more and better this page more in future.
